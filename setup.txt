[THIS IS OUTDATED RUN SETUP SCRIPT!!!]

Hello!
Run './Setup' to install and run game!
It is reccomended to just run the installer...
If you want to install it yourself follow below instructions : 
To set up the program, you need to make a virtual enviroment in python.
You can do this by running 'sudo apt install python3-full'
Then run 'python3 -m venv .venv' - This will create a virtual enviroment.
After that run 'source .venv/bin/activate' - this opens virtual enviroment. (you should see (.venv) before your
account name @ the hostname of your computer.
then run 'pip3 install tk' this installs a turtle dependency.
To get the cutscreens to work, 
run 'sudo python3 -m pip install opencv-python --break-system-packages' and run 'sudo apt install python3-pip'
pip3 install opencv-python'
